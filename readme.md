# BotDuino

BotDuino is a simple robot built using an Arduino Uno R3 board and a few other components. It represents a basic way of making a self-moving robot that can avoid obstacles.

## Components

  - 1x Arduino Uno board
  - 1x Motor Shield
  - 2x DC motors
  - 1 HC-SR04 Ultrasound sensor
  - 1x 6-battery holder
  - 6x AA rechargeable batteries
  - 1x green led
  - 1x red led
  - 2x 330 ohm resistors
